## id vs class

In html you can add attributes like id's or class's to name or add characteristics to a tag. In javascript you can search your document to find an id or a class. 

id - for use on only one tag.

When searching for id, javascript should return only the tag where that id was found.

class - for use on multiple tags

When searching for a class javascript will return all of the tags sharing the class name


## Grabbing Elements from a HTML Document

document.getElementById("amount")

This grabs an id and returns the tag object

var amount = document.getElementById("amount");

By attaching it to a variable you can get access object variables like:

* .value
 * This grabs the value of a form input
